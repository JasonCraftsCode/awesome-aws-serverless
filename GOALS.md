# Goals for awesome-aws-serverless

The biggest difficultly with any new technology, like serverless, is that things change at such a rapid
pace that is hard to keep up with all of the new information and also know when information is outdated.
The other awesome-* guides are great for the amount of resources they provide, but frequently I find
myself lost in a sea of resources unsure where to start and what info is out of date.

## Goals

- Provide overview of AWS serverless compatible managed services and provide some ranking against the 
ideal serverless characteristics
- Add created and updated dates to all resources to have an idea of how up to date the resources are
- Add author to resoruces to both give credit to the author and provide some idea of resource quality
- Ordered by overall quality, timelessness or up-to-dateness and usefulness
- Update change.log
- Focus on high quality and up to date resources, and avoid promotional, announcement or cick bait based material
- Have a separate aws-serverless-changelog.md that contains a data log of aws serverless changes
- Have an archived.md with out of date or not maintained resources

## Categories

- AWS offical documentation and resources
- Getting started... (Maybe have a gettingstarted.md)
- Books
- Courses
- Guides and Tutorials
- Articles
- Forms or discussions
- 3rd Party services and serverless ranking (based on characteristics)
- Tools
- Examples or Samples
- Podcasts
- Newsletters
- Blogs or Vlogs
- Feeds
- People championing serverless w/ contact info
- Reoccuring Conferences
- Events or one of conferences (maybe best to haven event.md to contain future/past events)

## Other considerations

Scope:

- AWS (or 3rd party) service specific (like dynamodb, SNS, SQS, EventBridge, ...)
- Cross service or general serverless

Purpose:

- Getting started (Where to start, what's next)
- In depth topics (Need to fully understand)
- Reference (How to...)
- Keeping up to date (use change log)
- Learn something new
- Entertainment or story
