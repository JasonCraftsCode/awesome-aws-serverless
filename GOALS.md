# Goals for awesome-aws-serverless

The biggest difficultly with any new technology, like serverless, is that things change at such a rapid
pace that is hard to keep up with all of the new information and also know when information is outdated.
The other awesome-* guides are great for the amount of resources they provide, but frequently I find
myself lost in a sea of resources unsure where to start and what info is out of date.

Goals:

- Provide overview of AWS serverless compatible managed services and provide some ranking against the 
ideal serverless characteristics
- Add created and updated dates to all resources to have an idea of how up to date the resources are
- Add author to resoruces to both give credit to the author and provide some idea of resource quality
- Update change.log
- Focus on high quality resources and avoid promotional based material
- Have a separate aws-serverless-changelog.md that contains a data log of aws serverless changes
- Have an archived.md with out of date or not maintained resources
